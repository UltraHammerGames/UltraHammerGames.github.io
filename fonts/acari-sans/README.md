Acari Sans (named after a fish native from Central and South America, also referred to as 'cascudo') is forked from Hanken Grotesk Version 1.045, last version that supports Cyrillic. The first modifications were duplexed tabular numerals, and fixing of some glyphs.  
In the new versions of Acari Sans (starting from v.1.070), the UPM value has been changed to 2048, which creates an entirely new geometry of glyphs. The H-height is now 1448 and the x-height is 1064. The Acari Sans family is based on 3 masters (Light, Bold, Black) with which are created the following weights: Light=300, Regular=400, Medium=500, SemiBold=600, Bold=700, ExtraBold=800, Black=900.

## About

Description of you and/or organisation goes here.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at `https://yourname.github.io/your-font-repository-name`.
